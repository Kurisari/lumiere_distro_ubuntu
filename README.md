## Changes

### Default repositories

We enabled the multiverse library, so we had to do an `enable default source`

**Multiverse:** Contains software that is not completely free, either for legal reasons (such as license restrictions) or technical reasons. Users can enable this repository if they need access to non-free software, but should be aware of the licensing and support implications.

### KDE environment

Installing the KDE Plasma desktop environment on Ubuntu is an excellent option if you are looking for a highly customizable user experience, especially for a distribution focused on gaming. KDE Plasma offers a wide range of customization options and themes that can improve both the aesthetics and functionality of the system.

#### What is KDE Plasma?

KDE Plasma is an advanced and versatile desktop environment for Linux-based operating systems. It is known for its:

High level of customization: Allows users to modify virtually every aspect of the desktop, from the layout and behavior of panels to themes and visual effects.
Efficient performance: KDE Plasma is optimized to be fast and efficient, even on older or resource-constrained hardware.
Rich collection of applications: It comes with a robust and well-integrated application suite, including the Dolphin file manager, Kate text editor, and KDE control center, among others.

### Boot Splash Screen Icon

The boot splash screen is the screen you see when the system is booting. On Ubuntu, this process is managed by Plymouth, a program that provides a graphical boot screen.

### Icons, themes and colors

In our case, although we tried to add new themes, icons and color schemes to customize the Ubuntu ISO with a gamer focus, the integration did not work as we expected. However, this process usually involves downloading and applying these elements through desktop environment customization tools, such as the "KDE Control Center" in KDE Plasma. These steps allow users to visually customize their system to improve the user experience and make it more in line with their tastes and needs.

### Extra applications

For a gaming-focused Ubuntu distribution, installing additional applications like Lutris and OBS Studio is essential. These tools expand the functionality of the system, allowing users to manage and record their gaming sessions efficiently.

#### What are Lutris and OBS Studio?

**Lutris**
Lutris is an open source platform that makes it easy to install, manage and run games on Linux. It's especially useful because it supports a wide range of games and platforms, including Windows titles through Wine, Steam, and console emulators.

**OBS Studio**
OBS Studio (Open Broadcaster Software Studio) is an open source tool for recording and live streaming video. It is popular among gamers and streamers for its robust capabilities and flexibility.

### Removing unused packages

When customizing and optimizing an Ubuntu distribution, especially one focused on gaming, removing packages that are not going to be used is an important practice to free up space, reduce resource use and improve system performance.
